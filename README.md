# Intersect (IX) Simulator with Restart Files

## Overview

This C++/MATLAB code serves as a simulator for the Intersect (IX) reservoir simulator (SLB software), designed to create restart files at specified time steps during the simulation. The user provides the initial restart time, and the code runs the simulation until the specified end time, generating restart files at regular intervals.
